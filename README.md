# webp_to_png
hate downloading an image and it's .webp, so this turns .webp to .png
## requirements
- **Python 3.x**

- **Pillow (PIL Fork)** `pip install pillow`
## usage
have the script in the same directory as your .webp files then run `python _webp_to_png.py` (note that it will **DELETE** the .webp files after it runs)

if you want to keep the .webp files, comment or delete **line 14** on the script
